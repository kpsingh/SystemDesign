	 * Letâ€™s say your application is distributed and it frequently serializes
	 * objects into the file system, only to read them later when required. Please
	 * note that de-serialization always creates a new instance.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * To solve this issue, we need to include a readResolve() method in our class.
	 * This method will be invoked when you will de-serialize the object. Inside of
	 * this method, you must return the existing instance to ensure a single
	 * instance application wide.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * For Serializable and Externalizable classes, the readResolve() method allows
	 * a class to replace/resolve the object read from the stream before it is
	 * returned to the caller. By implementing the readResolve method, a class can
	 * directly control the types and instances of its own instances being
	 * deserialized. The method is defined as follows:
	 * 
	 * ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER Object readResolve() throws ObjectStreamException;
	 * 
	 * The readResolve method is called when ObjectInputStream has read an object
	 * from the stream and is preparing to return it to the caller.
	 * 
	 * ObjectInputStream checks whether the class of the object defines the
	 * readResolve method. If the method is defined, the readResolve method is
	 * called to allow the object in the stream to designate the object to be
	 * returned. The object returned should be of a type that is compatible with all
	 * uses. If it is not compatible, a ClassCastException will be thrown when the
	 * type mismatch is discovered.

	/**
	 * Using the "clone" method, we can create a copy of the original object; it's
	 * the same thing if we applied clone in the singleton pattern. It will create
	 * two instances: one original and another one cloned object. In this case, we
	 * will break the Singleton principle.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * To overcome the above issue, we need to implement/override the clone() method
	 * and throw an exception CloneNotSupportedException from the clone method. If
	 * anyone tries to create a clone object of Singleton, it will throw an
	 * exception
